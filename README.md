# CriminalDataAnalysis

The past couple of years have witnessed an overall declining trend in crime rate in the United States. This, in part, is attributable to the improvement in law enforcement strategies especially the inclusion of computer-aided technology for effective and efficient deployment of police resources. These advancements have been complemented by the availability of a vast amount of data and the capability to handle them.

The main objective of this project is to design an R application which can help the users to analyse the crime which have been happening for some time, so that they can be more careful. Our web application can be used by person of any group and type. Even though there are many such applications designed by the developers but not many have the features that we are implementing in ours like finding safest route, analysing the crime trends with different plots, etc. The user friendliness is the main key for designing an efficient application which we kept in mind while designing ours.

Finally, our group was able to design an Crime Analysis web application. User could choose various plots for analysing various crimes according to the Area, Date and time of the day. The user could also find the safest route in which the path had the least chance of occurrence of crime.

Steps to run the App:-

(i) Include all the libraries from Libraries.R  (ii) Include the dataset and run the file preprocessing.R   (iii) Run the temp.R file   (iv) Run ui.R
